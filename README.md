Verany Website
=============

Welcome to the Verany Website source code! 

From this repository you can build the Website for editing, bug fixing and learning. Modify them in any way you can imagine, and share your changes with others! 

We have a heap of documentation available for the code on the web. If you're looking for the answer to something, you may want to start here: 

* [Core](https://dotspace.team/docs)
* [Verany Webpages](https://docs.verany.net/web)
* [Verany Client](https://docs.verany.net/client-addon)

If you need more, just ask! A lot of Verany developers hang out on the [forums](https://forums.verany.net/) or on our [TeamSpeak](https://ts3server://ts.verany.net/), 
and we're proud to be part of a well-meaning, friendly and welcoming team of developers and concept writers. 


Getting up and running
----------------------

The steps below will take you through cloning your own private fork, then compiling and running the editor yourself:

### Installation

1. Install **[GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)** then **[fork and clone our repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)**. 
   To use Git from the command line, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles.

   If you'd prefer not to use Git, you can get the source with the 'Download ZIP' button on the right. The built-in Windows zip utility will mark the contents of zip files 
   downloaded from the Internet as unsafe to execute, so right-click the zip file and select 'Properties...' and 'Unblock' before decompressing it. Third-party zip utilities don't normally do this.

2. Install **Visual Studio Code**. 
   All desktop editions of Visual Studio Code can run our website, including [Visual Studio Code 1.49](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_49), which is free for small teams and individual developers.

Have fun!
